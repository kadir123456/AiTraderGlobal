## 📝 **Değişiklikler**

1. ✅ `logger.info()` eklendi - ping/pong loglarını görebilirsin
2. ✅ `await asyncio.sleep(25)` - Her 25 saniyede ping
3. ✅ Task cancellation düzeltildi
4. ✅ Daha detaylı error logging

---

## 🚀 **Test Et**

Deploy ettikten sonra backend loglarında şunları göreceksin:
```
✅ New WebSocket connection. Active: 1
🔄 Started keep-alive task for connection
📡 Keep-alive task started
... (25 saniye sonra)
📡 Sent ping to client
... (25 saniye sonra)
📡 Sent ping to client
```

Frontend console'da:
```
📡 Received server ping, sending pong
📡 Sent ping
📡 Received pong from server
