    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Find answers to common questions about AI Trader",
    "q1": "How does the automated trading bot work?",
    "a1": "Our bot monitors EMA 9 and EMA 21 crossovers in real-time. When a bullish crossover occurs (EMA 9 crosses above EMA 21), it opens a LONG position. When a bearish crossover occurs, it opens a SHORT position. The bot automatically manages TP/SL levels based on your settings.",
    "q2": "Is my exchange API key safe?",
    "a2": "Yes. Your API keys are encrypted using AES-256 encryption and stored securely. We only require READ and TRADE permissions - never withdrawal permissions. Additionally, we recommend using IP whitelisting for extra security.",
    "q3": "Which exchanges are supported?",
    "a3": "We support major exchanges including Binance, Bybit, OKX, KuCoin, MEXC, and more. The number of exchanges you can connect depends on your subscription plan.",
    "q4": "What are the subscription plans?",
    "a4": "We offer three plans: Free (1 exchange, basic features), Pro ($25/month, unlimited exchanges, auto-trading), and Enterprise (custom pricing, dedicated support, custom strategies).",
    "q5": "Can I customize the trading strategy?",
    "a5": "Pro and Enterprise users can customize EMA periods, time intervals (15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d), leverage, TP/SL percentages, and position sizes. Free users have access to default settings.",
    "q6": "How do I stop the bot?",
    "a6": "You can disable auto-trading at any time from Settings > Auto Trading. This will stop the bot from opening new positions, but existing positions will remain open until you close them manually or they hit TP/SL.",
    "q7": "What happens if I reach my position limit?",
    "a7": "The bot will not open new positions once you reach your plan's limit. Free plan allows 3 positions, Pro allows 10, and Enterprise allows unlimited positions. Upgrade your plan for higher limits.",
    "q8": "Is there a money-back guarantee?",
    "a8": "Yes, we offer a 14-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. If you're not satisfied, contact support for a full refund.",
